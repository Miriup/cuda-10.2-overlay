# cuda-10.2-overlay
Gentoo portage overlay with backported ebuilds to support CUDA 10.2

This overlay contains Gentoo packages taken from the main tree - sometimes with backports - to allow running CUDA 10.2 with an otherwise up to date package database.
The aim is to support my NVIDIA GeForce 750M card until I have something better.
